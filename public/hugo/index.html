<blockquote>
<p>人生很短暂，如何度过。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, I want to chat about something that&rsquo;s been on my mind lately: time. You know, that elusive thing that seems to slip through our fingers like sand. As we grow older, our relationship with time changes. We become more aware of how quickly it passes and how nothing stays the same forever. It&rsquo;s a bit of a bummer, I know, but stick with me, it&rsquo;s not all doom and gloom!</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re kids, we feel like time is limitless. We have all the time in the world to go where we want, do what we want, be who we want. But as we get older, we become acutely aware of how quickly time is passing us by. It&rsquo;s like one moment you&rsquo;re building blanket forts with your siblings, and the next, you&rsquo;re graduating high school and moving out of the house.</p>
<p>Time flies, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing: as we journey through life, who we spend our time with changes. And I find this evolution incredibly fascinating. As children, we spend most of our time with our families. They&rsquo;re the ones who guide us and help us navigate the world. But as we enter adolescence, our time with family tails off, and we spend more time with friends. It&rsquo;s a crucial time for us to learn how to build relationships.</p>
<p>Fast forward to young adulthood, and our focus shifts to romantic relationships. We spend more time with our partner, building the foundations for our future. And at around the same time, we spend a significant number of our hours with our co-workers. But then, as we age, our social networks start to shrink. We retire, the kids leave the house, and we spend an increasing amount of time alone.</p>
<p>Now, I know that might sound a bit scary, but being alone doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to mean being lonely. In fact, I think it&rsquo;s important to learn to enjoy our own company. After all, we arguably spend more time alone than we do with anyone else, especially later in life.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the takeaway from all of this? Well, I&rsquo;ve got a few thoughts:
1、Prioritise time with family. Our days with them are numbered, so let&rsquo;s not brush off opportunities to connect with them more.
2、Be intentional about friendships. We don&rsquo;t need many friends, just a few good ones that we invest in.
3、Cherish time with kiddos. They grow up fast, and they don&rsquo;t stay in the nest for long.
4、Nurture healthy relationships with co-workers. We spend almost as much time with them as we do with our partners, so let&rsquo;s make it count.
5、Learn to be comfortable with being alone. It&rsquo;s not as scary as it sounds, I promise!</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s my take on time and how we spend it. But I&rsquo;m curious to hear your thoughts. Do you feel like you&rsquo;re spending your time wisely? How do you feel about spending more time alone as you get older?</p>
<p>Until next time, remember: life is short, so let&rsquo;s make the most of it.</p>
