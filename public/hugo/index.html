<blockquote>
<p>人生很短暂，如何度过。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, I want to chat about something that&rsquo;s been on my mind lately: time. You know, that elusive thing that seems to slip through our fingers like sand. As we grow older, our relationship with time changes. We become more aware of how quickly it passes and how nothing stays the same forever. It&rsquo;s a bit of a bummer, I know, but stick with me, it&rsquo;s not all doom and gloom!</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re kids, we feel like time is limitless. We have all the time in the world to go where we want, do what we want, be who we want. But as we get older, we become acutely aware of how quickly time is passing us by. It&rsquo;s like one moment you&rsquo;re building blanket forts with your siblings, and the next, you&rsquo;re graduating high school and moving out of the house.</p>
<p>Time flies, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing: as we journey through life, who we spend our time with changes. And I find this evolution incredibly fascinating. As children, we spend most of our time with our families. They&rsquo;re the ones who guide us and help us navigate the world. But as we enter adolescence, our time with family tails off, and we spend more time with friends. It&rsquo;s a crucial time for us to learn how to build relationships.</p>
<p>Fast forward to young adulthood, and our focus shifts to romantic relationships. We spend more time with our partner, building the foundations for our future. And at around the same time, we spend a significant number of our hours with our co-workers. But then, as we age, our social networks start to shrink. We retire, the kids leave the house, and we spend an increasing amount of time alone.</p>
<p>Now, I know that might sound a bit scary, but being alone doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to mean being lonely. In fact, I think it&rsquo;s important to learn to enjoy our own company. After all, we arguably spend more time alone than we do with anyone else, especially later in life.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the takeaway from all of this? Well, I&rsquo;ve got a few thoughts:
1、Prioritise time with family. Our days with them are numbered, so let&rsquo;s not brush off opportunities to connect with them more.
2、Be intentional about friendships. We don&rsquo;t need many friends, just a few good ones that we invest in.
3、Cherish time with kiddos. They grow up fast, and they don&rsquo;t stay in the nest for long.
4、Nurture healthy relationships with co-workers. We spend almost as much time with them as we do with our partners, so let&rsquo;s make it count.
5、Learn to be comfortable with being alone. It&rsquo;s not as scary as it sounds, I promise!</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s my take on time and how we spend it. But I&rsquo;m curious to hear your thoughts. Do you feel like you&rsquo;re spending your time wisely? How do you feel about spending more time alone as you get older?</p>
<p>Until next time, remember: life is short, so let&rsquo;s make the most of it.</p>

<h1 id="the-brain-is-a-predictive-organ">The Brain is a Predictive Organ</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>大脑很敏锐</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine for a moment that you could peer into the minds of those around you. What if you could glimpse the intricate tapestry of their thoughts, the ebb and flow of their emotions, and the hidden desires that drive their actions? What if you could harness this knowledge to navigate the complex dance of human interaction with unparalleled grace and effectiveness? These are the tantalising possibilities that emerge when we begin to understand the brain as a fundamentally predictive organ.</p>
<p>Here is an exploration of how our brains are constantly attempting to predict the future, and how we can leverage this knowledge to navigate the intricate tapestry of relationships and social dynamics. It&rsquo;s a profound journey of self-discovery, so prepare to be enlightened and intrigued.
Navigating the Social Game</p>
<p>Imagine yourself as a contestant on a groundbreaking psychological game show called &ldquo;The Social Labyrinth.&rdquo; Your objective is to forge alliances, negotiate agreements, and outmanoeuvre your competitors to emerge as the ultimate victor. Success hinges on your ability to read others, influence their perceptions, and strategically manage relationships.</p>
<p>As you enter the fray, you quickly realise that the behaviour of your fellow contestants is driven by their predictions. They&rsquo;re continuously attempting to anticipate each other&rsquo;s actions and motivations. Some, consumed by paranoia, become defensive and distrustful, assuming everyone is out to sabotage them. Others project their own hidden agendas onto their competitors, creating a maelstrom of emotion-driven assumptions.</p>
<p>But you possess a secret weapon: an understanding of the brain&rsquo;s predictive powers. By maintaining awareness of your own emotional state and expectations, you can sidestep reactive behaviour and maintain clarity of thought. Moreover, by attuning yourself to the emotional undercurrents of your interactions, you can subtly guide your fellow contestants towards more positive predictions.</p>
<p>Through active listening and genuine empathy, you cultivate a sense of understanding and support among your alliance partners. You reframe negotiations not as zero-sum conflicts, but as opportunities for collaboration and mutual benefit. Gradually, you construct a network of robust, trusting relationships. When the dust settles, you emerge triumphant—not through manipulation, but by fostering an environment where everyone feels valued and invested in collective success.
The Predictive Coach</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s shift our focus to how understanding the brain&rsquo;s predictive nature can be applied to the world of soccer coaching. As a coach, your role extends beyond teaching techniques and tactics—you must also navigate the emotional landscape of your team.</p>
<p>Consider a high-stakes match against your fiercest rivals. As your players take the field, their minds are awash with expectations. Some, haunted by memories of past defeats, anticipate another crushing loss. Others, assuming they are outmatched, begin to play with hesitation and fear. These negative predictions become self-fulfilling prophecies, colouring their perceptions and decision-making in detrimental ways.</p>
<p>As the coach, you have the power to reshape these predictions. In your pre-game speech, you vividly paint a picture of success. You remind your players of their strengths and past triumphs, igniting a fire of determination within them. You inspire them to embrace the challenge as an opportunity to prove their mettle. In essence, you provide their brains with a positive emotional roadmap for the impending battle.</p>
<p>Throughout the match, you continue to manage the team&rsquo;s emotional state from the touchline. When a player makes a mistake and becomes mired in self-doubt, you counter that negative prediction with encouragement and forward-focused guidance. When the team scores and the elation threatens to give way to complacency, you temper their emotional response, ensuring they remain focused and hungry.</p>
<p>By proactively shaping your players&rsquo; predictions, you enable them to perform at their peak. As they accumulate victories and build momentum, those positive expectations become self-reinforcing. They step onto the pitch with an unwavering belief in their abilities, and then proceed to play in a manner that brings those predictions to fruition.
Predicting Project Success</p>
<p>These principles are equally applicable in a business context, particularly when it comes to managing projects and teams. Imagine you&rsquo;re spearheading a critical initiative with a looming deadline. The pressure is immense, and your team is feeling the strain.</p>
<p>If you allow stress and uncertainty to take hold, negative predictions can quickly spiral out of control. Team members might begin to anticipate failure, convinced that the deadline is unattainable or that their colleagues will let them down. Left unchecked, these pessimistic expectations can sabotage the project, causing people to disengage or make impulsive, short-sighted decisions.</p>
<p>However, if you proactively manage the team&rsquo;s predictions, you can steer the ship towards calmer waters. It starts with your own emotional state and expectations. By projecting calm confidence and focusing on solutions rather than dwelling on risks, you establish an emotional tone that permeates the entire team.</p>
<p>It continues with how you communicate about the project. Rather than fixating on the obstacles, you highlight progress and celebrate small victories. You consistently paint a vivid picture of what success looks like, igniting excitement about the impact the team is poised to make. In doing so, you provide their brains with a positive future to predict and strive towards.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t mean ignoring problems or sugarcoating reality. You must still confront challenges head-on with a realistic approach. However, by framing setbacks as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than portents of doom, you keep the team&rsquo;s predictions—and, consequently, their behaviour—oriented towards success.
Emotional Awareness in Friendships</p>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s explore how understanding the brain&rsquo;s predictive nature can help us navigate the occasionally treacherous waters of friendship and social bonds. Our relationships with friends and loved ones are deeply emotional, which makes them particularly susceptible to the distortions of negative predictions.</p>
<p>Recall a time when a close friend unexpectedly lashed out at you. Chances are, your brain immediately leapt to conclusions, predicting a myriad of negative explanations for their behaviour. &ldquo;They must be angry with me,&rdquo; you might assume, or &ldquo;They no longer care about our friendship.&rdquo; Overwhelmed by emotion, you might react with a harsh retort or retreat into hurt silence.</p>
<p>But what if, in that charged moment, you could pause and interrogate your predictions? What if, instead of assuming the worst, you approached the situation with curiosity about your friend&rsquo;s true emotional state? Perhaps they are grappling with personal stresses and inadvertently projecting their negativity onto you. Or maybe a miscommunication has occurred, and they are reacting to a perceived slight that you never intended.</p>
<p>By slowing down and questioning your own emotional assumptions, you create space for a more thoughtful, empathetic response. Instead of reacting based on knee-jerk predictions, you can choose to extend the benefit of the doubt. You can gently probe to understand your friend&rsquo;s authentic feelings and work together to realign your perspectives.</p>
<p>This is easier said than done, of course. When we&rsquo;re hurt or angry, those emotion-driven predictions can feel like incontrovertible truths. But with practice, we can learn to catch ourselves in the act of assumption-making. We can cultivate the habit of pausing, breathing, and broadening our predictive lens. In doing so, we give our friendships the best possible chance to flourish and deepen.
Why I love this concept?</p>
<p>My fascination with this concept of the brain as a predictive organ stems from my diverse experiences across technology, strategy, and leadership roles. As a CTO, I&rsquo;ve witnessed firsthand how emotions and expectations can shape the trajectory of projects and teams. When negative predictions take hold, progress stalls and morale suffers. But by proactively managing the emotional landscape and fostering positive, forward-looking mindsets, I&rsquo;ve been able to guide teams through challenging times and achieve remarkable results.</p>
<p>Similarly, my background in consulting and entrepreneurship has taught me the power of influencing perceptions and building strong relationships. Whether I&rsquo;m advising C-suite executives, negotiating partnerships, or pitching to investors, the ability to understand and shape others&rsquo; predictions has been a critical factor in my success. By attuning myself to the emotional undercurrents of each interaction and strategically guiding expectations, I&rsquo;ve been able to forge powerful alliances and drive transformative outcomes.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my journey has reinforced the notion that mastering the brain&rsquo;s predictive powers is a key to effective leadership, innovation, and growth. By cultivating emotional intelligence, questioning our assumptions, and proactively shaping the narrative, we can unlock the full potential of ourselves and those around us. It&rsquo;s a skill that transcends any one domain or role—a fundamental tool for navigating the complexities of human interaction and achieving extraordinary things.
Mastering the Predictive Brain</p>
<p>From game shows to sports fields, boardrooms to living rooms, the brain&rsquo;s predictive powers exert a profound influence on our behaviour and relationships. By understanding how emotions shape our expectations, and how those expectations, in turn, shape our reality, we gain a measure of mastery over our inner world and our interpersonal landscape.</p>
<p>We can learn to regulate our own predictions, maintaining composure in stressful situations and making decisions guided by our values rather than our fears. We can learn to influence others&rsquo; predictions, not through manipulation, but through authentic, emotionally intelligent engagement. And we can learn to question our assumptions, both about ourselves and others, fostering deeper understanding and connection.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goal is not to become Machiavellian puppeteers, bending others to our will. Rather, it is to become more skilful stewards of our own minds and more compassionate actors in the grand social dance of life. By appreciating the predictive brain, in all its power and potential pitfalls, we take a significant step towards greater self-awareness, more fulfilling relationships, and a more positive impact in whatever sphere we find ourselves.</p>
<p>The journey is not always easy, but it is undeniably worthwhile. By staying attuned to our own emotions, remaining curious about the feelings of others, and consistently challenging our reflexive assumptions, we can navigate even the most complex social labyrinths with grace, empathy, and wisdom. So, dear reader, embrace the power of your predictive brain, and step forward into a world of richer connections and more meaningful influence.</p>
